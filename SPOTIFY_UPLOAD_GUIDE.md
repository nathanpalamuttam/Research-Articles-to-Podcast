# How to Listen to Your Podcasts on Spotify

## The Problem
Spotify doesn't allow direct uploads of custom audio files. You need a podcast hosting service.

## Solutions (Ranked by Ease)

### Option 1: Use Anchor (Free & Easiest) ✅ RECOMMENDED
Anchor is owned by Spotify and automatically distributes to Spotify.

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://anchor.fm
2. Sign up for free account
3. Click "New Episode"
4. Upload your MP3 files from `outputs/audio/`
5. Publish episodes
6. Anchor automatically submits to Spotify (takes 24-48 hours)
7. Search for your podcast on Spotify mobile app

**Pros:**
- Free
- Automatic Spotify distribution
- No technical setup
- Mobile app for easy uploads

**Cons:**
- Manual upload for each episode
- 24-48 hour delay

**Steps:**
1. Upload MP3s to Google Drive/Dropbox (public)
2. Use a service like Podbean or Buzzsprout (free tier)

### Option 3: Self-Host with RSS Feed (Technical)
Create your own RSS feed and submit to Spotify.

**Requirements:**

**I can help you build this if you want!**

### Option 4: Local Playback (Immediate, but Phone Only)
For immediate listening without uploading:

**On iPhone:**
1. Use AirDrop to send MP3 to your phone
2. Save to Files app
3. Play in Apple Podcasts or VLC

**On Android:**
1. Use Google Drive or Dropbox
2. Download MP3
3. Play in any podcast app (Pocket Casts, etc.)

## My Recommendation

**For Quick Setup:** Use **Anchor.fm**
- Create account in 2 minutes
- Upload MP3s via web or mobile app
- Automatically appears on Spotify in 1-2 days

**For Automation:** I can build you an **automated uploader** that:
1. Detects new MP3s in `outputs/audio/`
2. Uploads to Anchor via API
3. Publishes automatically

Would you like me to build the automated uploader?

## Alternative: Private Podcast Feed

I can also create a **private RSS feed** that:
- Hosts your podcasts
- Works with any podcast app (including Spotify-compatible apps)
- Updates automatically when you generate new episodes
- Accessible only by you (via private URL)

Let me know which option you prefer!
